### One line summary

**This app provides the user with an intuitive way to control the LapseR timelapse-rails**

### Problem Statement

This app makes sure one can interact with the LapseR-rails intuitively and easily.
LapseR comes to help where filmmakers want to create beautiful timelapses.
Timelapses nowadays are used more and more by both professional and amateur filmmakers, and with LapseR, one can create panning and moving timelapses.

#### What is a timelapse?

A timelapse embodies the photographic technique of taking a sequence of frames at set intervals to record changes that take place slowly over time.
When the frames are shown at normal speed the action seems much faster. Normal timelapses are shot using a tripod or something comparable.
With LapseR, the camera itself moves slowly as well. This results in a very nice timelapse, where object nearby are slowly moving through frame.
Also, one can focus on an nearby object that goes through a process that is slow (painting, 3d-printing, etc.)
With LapseR, one can easily capture this action.

#### What does LapseR that does not exist?

LapseR provides a very high quality, but not as expensive solution for filmmakers that want to use timelapses in their video's.
